## Adding examples of artificial humour

Make sure that every item you have added:
- is funny and original (i.e. _awesome_)
- contains a link
- but also a short description. If it's a research paper, use its abstract instead.
- doesn't contain any fluff, i.e. images or long walls of text
- is in the correct section of the list

Feel free to explain your motivation in the pull request or just let your links speak for themselves.

## Removing examples of artificial humour

For every item you remove, please explain in the pull request why you believe it doesn't cut it.

## Beware

The default branch in this project is called `main`, not `master`. Sorry for the inconvenience, this is required by [the awesome project](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).
